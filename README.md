# drf-vuejs-demo
A demo implementation Django Rest Framework and Vue.js

## Motivation
I looked around for a simple explanation of how you could use Vue.js with Django and was disappointed. This is my attempt at showing how you could do this.

For simplicity's sake, most of the magic happens in the [index template](https://github.com/raiderrobert/drf-vuejs-demo/blob/master/polls/templates/polls/index.html) in the project.
